Apache Spark is a fast and general-purpose distributed / cluster computing system. It provides high-level APIs in Java, Scala, Python and R, and an optimized engine that supports general execution graphs. It also supports a rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and structured data processing, MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing, and Spark Streaming.

## Basics

### Architecture  

A Job includes multiple RDDs.

A RDD can be broken into multiple Stages.

A Stage gets broken into multiple Tasks that are distributed to nodes on the cluster and then executed.

![spark-architecture.png](img/spark-architecture.png)

![spark-architecture-2.png](img/spark-architecture-2.png)

![spark-architecture-4.png](img/spark-architecture-4.png)

- 1 worker node - n executors 
- 1 executor - n threads
- 1 thread - 1 task
- 1 task - produces 1 partition (data block)

There is a **BlockManager** storage module in **Executor**, which uses both RAM and disk as storage devices in order to reduce IO overhead effectively.

When executing an application, Driver will apply resources from Cluster Manager, start up Executors, send program code and files to Executors, and then execute Tasks on Executors.

![spark-architecture-3.png](img/spark-architecture-3.png)

### Spark Job Architecture

![spark-job-architecture.png](img/spark-job-architecture.png)

---

### Cluster Resource Manager

- Standalone
- Yarn
- Mesos
- Kubernetes

Spark built-in cluster resource manager (standalone) is not easy to use. It is more limited than other cluster managers. The cluster can only run Spark. **DO NOT** use it generally.

Mesos integrates with Spark better than Yarn.

You can use Mesos and Yarn at the same time. Mesos is for **coarse-grained** management allocating resource to Docker, and then Yarn is for **fine-grained** management.

---

### Life Cycle of a Spark Application

#### Outside Spark (cluster mode)

1. Client Request
    1. You submit an application executing code on your local machine through `spark-submit`.
    2. Make a request to the cluster manager driver node explicitly asking for resources for the **Spark driver process** only.
    3. Cluster manager places the driver process onto a node in the cluster.
    4. The **client process exits** and application is off and running on the cluster.
2. Launch
    1. The driver process runs user code on the cluster including a SparkSession that initializes a Spark cluster.
    2. The SparkSession communicates with the cluster manager asking it to launch **Spark executor processes** across the cluster.
    3. The cluster manager responds by launching the executor processes and sends the relevant information about their locations to the driver process.
3. Execution
    1. The driver and the workers communicate among themselves, executing code and moving data around.
4. Completion
    1. The driver process exits with either success or failure.
    2. The cluster manager then shuts down the executors.
    3. You can see the success or failure of the Spark Application by asking the cluster manager.
 
#### Inside Spark 

1. Create a SparkSession (the first step of any Spark Application).
2. Execute code.

---

### Pipelining

- Spark performs as many steps as it can at one point in time before writing data to memory or disk.
- It occurs at and below the RDD level.
- With pipelining, any sequence of operations that feed data directly into each other, without needing to move it across nodes, is collapsed into a single stage of tasks that do all the operations together.

---

### RDDs

- A RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset) is essentially a **read-only** immutable, partitioned collection of records. Each record is just a Scala, Java or Python object.
- **Each RDD can be divided into multiple partitions.** Each partition is a dataset fragment. Each partition can be stored on different nodes in the cluster. (parallel computing)

![rdd-partition-record.png](img/rdd-partition-record.png)

- RDDs are stored in the executors or on worker nodes.
- **Virtually everything in Spark is built on top of RDDs.**
- RDD API is similar to the Dataset, except that RDDs are not stored in, or manipulated with, the structured data engine.
- **One thing that you might use RDDs** for is to parallelize raw data that you have stored in memory on the driver machine. For instance, `spark.sparkContext.parallelize(Seq(1,2,3)).toDF()`.
- Read a text file line by line: `spark.sparkContext.textFile("<directory>")`. Each line corresponds to each record in a RDD. 
- Read text files, each text file becomes a record: `spark.sparkContext.wholeTextFiles("<directory>")`.
    - The 1st object is the name of the file.
    - The 2nd string object is the value of the text file.

There are lots of subclasses of RDD. You will likely only create two types: 

- generic RDD type
- key-value RDD 

**When to use RDDs:** when you need fine-grained control over the physical distribution of data (custom partitioning of data).

#### Printing Elements of an RDD

It is common to print out the elements of an RDD using `<rdd_var>.foreach(println)` or `<rdd_var>.map(println)`.

- On a single machine, OK.
- In cluster mode, the methods called by executors will print output on executors rather than the driver.

To print all elements on the driver, you may use collect all RDDs to the driver firstly and then print: `<rdd_var>.collect().foreach(println)`.

- This will cause the driver to run out of memory.
- Thus, only print a few elements for testing: `<rdd_var>.take(<number_of_elements>).foreach(println)`.

#### RDD Running Process

1. Create RDD objects.
2. SparkContext calculates the dependency relationship between RDDs, and build DAG. 
3. DAGScheduler splits the DAG into stages, each of which contains multiple tasks. 
4. TaskScheduler distributes tasks to worker nodes, and launch them.
5. Executors on the work nodes execute tasks.

![rdd-running-process-2.png](img/rdd-running-process-2.png)

![rdd-running-process-3.png](img/rdd-running-process-3.png)

![spark-transformations-dag.png](img/spark-transformations-dag.png)


#### Stage Division & Dependencies

- Narrow dependencies: The relationship between RDDs is 1 : 1 or many : 1.
- Wide dependencies: The relationship between RDDs is 1 : many or many : many.

Create a new stage when it comes across wide dependencies.

![stage-division-according-to-dependencies.png](img/stage-division-according-to-dependencies.png)

Optimize for dependencies:  

- Do as many narrow dependencies together before hitting a wide dependency.  
- Try to group wide dependency transformations together, possibly inside a single function and do it once. 

---

### Partitioning

**If you often access a column when reading data, you can partition by it when writing the data for optimization.**

As you do this, you encode this column as a folder. When you read data later, it allows you to skip lots of data and only read in relevant data instead of having to scan the complete dataset. E.g. `<dataFrameName>.write.format("parquet").partitionBy("<columnName>").save("<filePath>")`.

It is supported for all file-based data sources.

Sometimes it is **advisable** to sort within each partition using `sortWithinPartitions` before another set of transformations.
    - E.g. `spark.read.format("json").load("filePath").sortWithinPartitions("<columnName>")`.
  
If there is no partitioner, the partitioning is not based upon characteristic of data but distribution is random and uniformed across nodes.

```scala
// default partitioner
rdd.partitionBy(<numberOfPartitions>)
// or HashPartitioner
rdd.partitionBy(new HashPartitioner(<numberOfPartitions>))
// RangePartitioner
rdd.partitionBy(new RangePartitioner(<numberOfPartitions>, rdd))
```

Get partition number of a Dataset or DataFrame: `<dataset_or_dataFrame>.rdd.partitions.size`.

Get partition number of a RDD: 

- `<rdd>.partitions.size`
- `<rdd>.getNumPartitions`

#### Downsides

If you partition at too fine a granularity, it can result in many small files (**small file problem**), and a great deal of overhead trying to list all the files in the storage system.

#### Partitioning Rule

- The number of partitions should be equal to the number or its integer multiple (2~3) of CPU cores in the cluster as possible.
- Each partition is generally between 100 - 200 MB.

#### Default Partition Number

Configure default partition number through set the parameter `spark.default.parallelism`.

- Local model: Number of CPU of local machine. If `local[N]` has been set, default partition number is N.
- Mesos: 8.
- Standalone or Yarn: Max value between number of CPU cores in the cluster and 2.

#### Manually Configure Partition

RDD partitioning is automatic but can be done manually through programming.

- When creating a RDD using `textFile()` or `parallelize()` methods, specify it. For example, `sc.textFile(<path>, <partitionNum>)`.
  - By default, Spark creates one partition for each block of the file (blocks being 128MB by default in HDFS).
  - You cannot have fewer partitions than blocks.
- When getting a new RDD by transformation, invoke `repartition(<partitionNum>)` method. For example, `rdd2 = rdd1.repartition(4)`. 4 partitions.

---

### Partitioner

#### HashPartitioner

Default partitioner of Spark.

HashPartitioner works on Java’s `Object.hashcode()`. Objects which are equal should have the same hashcode. So, HashPartitioner will divide the keys that have the same hashcode(). 

`partitionNo = hashCode % numberOfPartitions`

Work for discrete values.

#### RangePartitioner 

RangePartitioner will sort the records in almost equal ranges based on the key and then it will divide the records into a number of partitions based on the given value. The ranges are determined by sampling the content of the RDD passed in.

Work for continuous values.

#### CustomPartitioner

You can also customize the number of partitions you need and what should be stored in those partitions by extending the default Partitioner class in Spark.

Specifying your own custom Partitioner can give you significant performance and stability improvements if you use it correctly. You control exactly how data is laid out on the cluster and manipulate that individual partition accordingly.

Do this **only** when you have lots of domain knowledge about your problem space. 

Steps:

1. Drop down to RDDs from the Structured APIs.
2. Apply your custom partitioner.
3. Convert it back to a DataFrame or Dataset.

Used to deal with data skew (some keys have many, many more values than other keys):

- break these keys
- improve parallelism
- prevent OutOfMemoryErrors

---

### Bucketing

- Bucketing create a certain number of files and organize your data into those "buckets".
- Data with the same bucket ID will all be grouped together into one physical partition.
- The data is pre-partitioned according to how you expect to use that data later on, which avoids shuffles later when you go to read the data.
- E.g. `<dataFrameName>.write.format("parquet").bucketBy(<numberBuckets>, "<columnNameToBucketBy>").saveAsTable("<bucketedFilesName>")`.
- It is supported only for Spark-managed tables.

---

### Coalesce VS Repartition

#### Coalesce

- Coalesce is fast in certain situations because it minimizes data movement.
- Merge partitions on the same node into one partition.
- Coalesce changes the number of nodes by moving data from some partitions to existing partitions. This algorithm obviously **cannot increase** the number of partitions.
  - For example, `numbersDf.rdd.partitions.size` is 4. Even if you use `numbersDf.coalesce(6)`, it is still 4 rather than 6.
- **Avoids a full data shuffle.**

#### Repartition

- Repartition can be used to either increase or decrease the number of partitions in a DataFrame.
- Does a **full data shuffle**.
- If there is only a little amount of data but the number of partitions is big, there will be many empty partitions.
- You should **only** repartition when the future number of partitions is greater than the current number of partitions or when you are looking to partition by a set of columns.
- If you are going to be filtering by a certain column often, it can be worth repartitioning based on that column. E.g. `df.repartition(col("<columnName>"))`, or `df.repartition(<numberOfPartitions>, col("<columnName>"))`.

#### Real World Example

1. Suppose you have a data lake that contains 2 billion (2x10^9) rows of data (1TB) split in 13,000 partitions.
2. You want to create a data puddle containing 2,000 rows of data for the purpose of development by random sampling of one millionth of the data lake.
3. Write the data puddle out to S3 for easy access.

```scala
val dataPuddle = dataLake.sample(true, 0.000001)
dataPuddle.write.parquet("s3a://my_bucket/puddle/")
```

4. Spark does not adjust the number of partitions, so the dataPuddle will also have 13,000 partitions, which means a lot of the partitions will be empty.
5. Not efficient to read or write thousands of empty text files to S3. Improve by repartitioning.

```scala
val dataPuddle = dataLake.sample(true, 0.000001)
val goodPuddle = dataPuddle.repartition(4)
goodPuddle.write.parquet("s3a://my_bucket/puddle/")
```

6. **Why choosing 4 partitions here?** 2x10^9 rows with 13,000 partitions. Thus, 2,000 rows with: 13,000 partitions / 1,000,000 ≈ 1 partition. Then `number_of_partitions = number_of_cpus_in_cluster * 4` (2, 3 or 4).
7. **Why using repartition instead of coalesce here?** The data puddle is small, so a full data shuffle is not expensive. The repartition method returns equal sized text files, which are more efficient for downstream consumers.

- **When filtering large DataFrames into smaller ones, you should almost always repartition the data.**
- **If you are reducing the number of overall partitions, first try `coalesce`.**

---

### Shared Variables

#### Broadcast Variables

When you use a variable in a closure, it must be deserialized on the worker nodes many times (one per task).

Broadcast variables let you save a large **immutable** value (such as a lookup table or a machine learning model) cached on all the worker nodes instead of serialized with every single task and reuse it across many Spark actions without re-sending it to the cluster. 

- Use `SparkContext.broadcast(<var>)` to create a broadcast variable from a normal variable, which is cached on each machine.
- The broadcast variable is like a wrapper of its corresponding normal variable.
- The broadcasted data is cached in serialized form and deserialized before running each task.
- All functions in the cluster can access the broadcast variable, thereby you do not need to repeatedly send the original normal variable to all nodes.
- After the broadcast variable is created, it should be used instead of the original normal variable in any functions run on the cluster.
And the original normal variable cannot be modified (is **read-only**). Consequently, the broadcast variable on all nodes are the same.
- **When to use**: when a very large variable need to be used repeatedly.
- Use case: pass around a large lookup table that fits in memory on the executors and use that in a
function.

For instance,

1. Create: `val broadcastVar = spark.sparkContext.broadcast(Array(1,2,3))`
2. Get value: `broadcastVar.value`

#### Accumulators

Accumulators are a way of updating a value inside of a variety of transformations and propagating that value to the driver node in an efficient and fault-tolerant way.

Accumulators let you add together data from all the tasks into a shared result. 

- Use case: counters or sum functions.
- Accumulators are available on worker nodes, but **worker nodes cannot read them**.
- **Driver node is the only one that can read and compute the aggregate of all updates.** 
- Spark natively supports accumulators of numeric types, and programmers can add support for new types through extending class `AccumulatorV2`.
- Named accumulators will display their running
results in the Spark UI, whereas unnamed ones will not.
- Create: 

```scala
/*
 * unnamed accumulators
 */
val <accumulatorVar> = new LongAccumulator 
spark.sparkContext.register(<accumulatorVar>)

/*
 * named accumulators
 */
val <accumulatorVar> = new LongAccumulator
spark.sparkContext.register(<accumulatorVar>, "<accumulatorName>")
// or
val <accumulatorVar> = spark.sparkContext.longAccumulator("<accumulatorName>")
```

- Use: `<accum_var>.add(<number>)`
- Get value:`<accum_var>.value`.

For instance,

1. Create: `val nErrors = sc.accumulator(0.0)`
2. Load file: `val logs = sc.textFile("/Users/akuntamukkala/temp/output.log")`
3. Count number of "error": `logs.filter(_.contains(“error”)).foreach(x => nErrors += 1)`
4. Get value: `nErrors.value`

##### Accumulator Update

- For action operations, accumulator updates in each task will only be applied once even if the task restarts.
- For transformation operation, each task’s update may be applied more than once if tasks or job stages are re-executed.
- Accumulator updates are not guaranteed to be executed when made within a lazy transformation because of lazy evaluation.

---

### Caching / Persisting

- By default, each transformed RDD may be recomputed each time you run an action on it.
- Cache or persist datasets in memory on nodes.
- Future actions are faster (often by more than 10x).
- `<rdd_var>.cache()` for default storage level - `MEMORY_ONLY`, which stores the
rdd as unserialized Java objects.
- Or `<rdd_var>.persist()` with a specified StorageLevel parameter.
- When Spark estimates that a partition will not fit in memory, it simply will not store it. 

#### Remove Cache

- Spark removes cached data automatically in a least-recently-used (LRU) fashion.
- Or use `<rdd_var>.unpersist()` if you want manually.

#### When to Cache Data

- When doing data validation and cleansing.
- When querying a small “hot” dataset.
- Cache for iterative algorithm like PageRank.
- Generally, **DO NOT** use for input data as input data is too large.
- Likely to be referenced by multiple actions.
- Relatively small compared to the amount of memory/disk.
- Expensive to regenerate.

#### Storage Level

- `MEMORY_ONLY` is the 1st choice.
- `MEMORY_ONLY_SER` is the 2nd choice. (Java and Scala)
- **DO NOT** use disk unless computing datasets are expensive, or amount of the data is large. Recomputing a partition may be as fast as reading it from disk.

---

### Checkpointing 

Saving an RDD to disk. 

Future references to this RDD point to those intermediate partitions on disk rather than recomputing the RDD from its original source.

In v2.1.0, Spark introduced checkpoints on data frames and datasets.

```scala
spark.sparkContext.setCheckpointDir("/some/path/for/checkpointing")

rdd.checkpoint()

df.checkpoint()
```

Spark relies on checkpoints to provide fault tolerance.

#### Reliable V.S. Local Checkpointing 

- Reliable checkpointing: Save RDD in a reliable distributed file system, e.g. HDFS. 
- Local checkpointing: Specific to Spark Streaming and GraphX. 

#### Metadata V.S. Data Checkpointing

Metadata checkpointing: 

- Configurations
- Stream operations
- Incomplete batches

Data checkpointing:

- Save RDD to storage.

---

### Shuffle

A shuffle represents a physical repartitioning of the data.

- Shuffle moves data across worker nodes, which is costly.
- It involves disk I/O, data serialization, and network I/O.
- It generates a large number of intermediate files on disk. (shuffle persistence) 
    - Spark has the "source" tasks (those sending data) write shuffle files to their local disks. 
    - Running a new job over data that has already been shuffled does not rerun the "source" side of the shuffle.
- By default, when we perform a shuffle, Spark outputs 200 shuffle partitions. You can specify it through `spark.conf.set("spark.sql.shuffle.partitions", "<number_of_shuffle_you_want>")`.
- Use minimal shuffle as possible and do them in late stages for better performance.  

No shuffle transformations:  

- map
- filter  
- flatMap
- mapPartitions  
- ...

Shuffle transformations:  

- distinct  
- groupByKey  
- reduceByKey
- join  
- countByValue
- sort
- sortByKey
- ...

#### External Shuffle Service

Used for storing shuffle blocks (outputs) so that they are available to all executors. Then you can arbitrarily kill executors and still have their shuffle outputs available to other applications.

---

### UDFs

Spark will serialize the UDF on the driver and transfer it over the network to all executor processes.

If the function is written in Scala or Java,

- little performance penalty. 
- performance issues if you create or use a lot of objects.

If the function is written in Python,

1. Spark starts a Python process on the worker, serializes all of the data to a format that Python can understand.
2. Executes the function row by row on that data in the Python process.
3. Returns the results of the row operations to the JVM and Spark.

Starting this Python process and serializing the data to Python are expensive. **Recommend writing UDFs in Scala or Java.**

**Best practice**: define the return type for the UDF when you define it.

Steps:

1. Define a function.
2. Convert the function into a UDF.
3. Apply the UDF to DataFrame or Dataset.

---

### Lazy Evaluation

Lazy evaulation means that Spark will wait until the very last moment to execute the graph of
computation instructions.

Taking advantage of lazy evaluation:  

- Do as many transformations as possible before hitting an action.  
- Avoid debugging statements with shuffle, e.g. printing counts.  

---

### API

![transformation-api.png](img/transformation-api.png)

![action-api.png](img/action-api.png)

The difference between `foreach()` and `map()`:

- `foreach()`: Returns void or no return value.
- `map()`: Returns dataset object.

`map()`: Row based.

`mapPartitions()`: Partition based.

`mapPartitionsWithIndex()`: The partition index is the partition number in the RDD.

`glom()`: Takes every partition in the dataset and converts each partition to an array. This can be useful if you are going to collect the data to the driver and want to have an array for each partition.

```scala
spark.sparkContext.parallelize(Seq("Hello", "World"), 2).glom.collect()
// Array(Array(Hello), Array(World))
```

**DO NOT** use `groupByKey() + reduce()` if you can use `reduceByKey()`.

- `groupByKey()` does not receive functions as parameter. When invoking it, Spark will move all key-value pairs, which result in big overhead and transmission delay. And each executor must hold all values for a given key in memory before applying the function to them. If you have massive key skew, you will get OutOfMemoryErrors.
- But if you have consistent value sizes for each key and know that they will fit in the memory of a given executor, you are going to be just fine.

![groupByKey.png](img/groupByKey.png)

![reduceByKey.png](img/reduceByKey.png)

- `groupBy`: returns RelationalGroupedDataset
- `groupByKey`: returns KeyValueGroupedDataset


Very rare, very low-level aggregation methods: 

- aggregate
- treeAggregate
- aggregateByKey
- combineByKey
- foldByKey

Used to combine RDDs:

- cogroup
- join
- cartesian (**very dangerous**)
- zip

---

### Serialization

Any object that you hope to parallelize (or function) must be serializable.

The default serialization is slow. 

#### Kryo

Spark can use the Kryo library (version 2) to serialize objects more quickly.

Kryo is significantly faster and more compact than Java serialization (often as much as 10x).

Does not support all serializable types.

Need to register the classes you will use in the program in advance for best performance.

**Recommend** trying it in any network-intensive application.

Since Spark 2.0.0, we internally use Kryo serializer when shuffling RDDs with simple types, arrays of simple types, or string type.

---

### Datasets

Datasets and DataFrames are distributed table-like collections with well-defined rows and columns.

After Spark 2.0, RDDs are replaced by Datasets. The RDD interface is still supported. **The trend in Spark is to use RDDs less and Datasets more.**

Datasets are similar to RDDs but are **strongly typed** that mapped to relational schema.

Datasets can explicitly wrap a given struct or type. (Dataset[Person], Dataset[(String, Double)])

The Dataset API gives users the ability to assign a Java/Scala class to the records within a DataFrame and manipulate it as a collection of typed objects.

**Recommend** using Datasets only with user-defined encoding surgically and only where it makes sense. This might be at the beginning of a big data pipeline or at the end of one.

Think of Datasets as a blend between the higher-level Structured APIs and the low-level RDD APIs.

#### Advantages

- Datasets are more efficient.
  - They can be serialized very efficiently, even better than Kryo.
  - Optimal execution plans can be determined at compile time.
- Datasets allow for better interoperability.
  - MLLib and Spark Streaming are moving toward using Datasets instead of RDDs for their primary API.  
- Datasets simplify development.
  - You can perform most SQL operations on a dataset with one line.

Processing or transmitting over the network:

- RDD: using Java serialization or Kryo.
- Dataset: using a specialized Encoder to serialize the objects.
  - This Encoder is highly optimized and generates bytecode at run time for serialization and deserialization.

Two ways to create a Dataset:

- from Hadoop InputFormats (such as HDFS files).
- by transforming other Datasets.

When to use Datasets: 

- When your code needs high-level abstraction, rich semantics and domain specific APIs. 
- If processing requires high-level expressions, filters, aggregations, SQL queries, columnar access.
- If high degree of compile time and run time type safety is required.
- To take advantage of performance optimizations from Catalyst. 
- To take advantage of efficient dynamic code generation from Tungsten. 

#### Disadvantages

- Cost of performance: Spark converts the Row format (domain specifies type) to the object you specified (a case class or Java class).
- By specifying a function, you are forcing Spark to evaluate this function on every row in your Dataset. This can be very resource intensive. For simple filters it is always **preferred** to write
SQL expressions.

#### `joinWith()`

DatasetA `joinWith` DatasetB ends up with two nested Datasets. Each column represents one Dataset. 

##### `join()` VS `joinWith()`

![join-vs-joinWith.png](img/join-vs-joinWith.png)

DataFrames can also join Datasets.

---

### DataFrames 

- A DataFrame simply represents a table of data with rows and columns. 
- A DataFrame is a kind of distributed dataset on basis of RDD.
- A DataFrame is a distributed set of `Row` objects or Dataset of type Row (`Dataset[Row]`).
- Each `Row` object represents a row of record, which provides detailed schema info.
- `Row` is an untyped JVM object.
- Through DataFrame, Spark SQL is able to know column name and type of the dataset.
- When you are using DataFrames, you are taking advantage of Spark's optimized internal Catalyst format. 
- Can be created from:
  - structured data files
  - Hive tables
  - external databases
  - existing RDDs: `val myDF = spark.createDataFrame(myRDD, mySchema)`

#### RDD VS DataFrame VS Dataset

- For RDD, columns are accessed with position number: `rdd.filter(line => line.split(",")(1) == "Alice")`
- For DataFrame, columns are accessed by column name: `df.filter(df("name") === "Alice")`
- For Dataset, columns are accessed by object attribute: `ds.filter(obj => obj.name == "Alice")`

DataFrame maps to a collection of Row-type objects. 

Dataset maps to a collection of objects. 

DataFrames schema is inferred at **runtime**; but a Dataset can be inferred at **compile time**, which implies faster detection of errors and better optimization.

[A Tale of Three Apache Spark APIs: RDDs vs DataFrames and Datasets](https://databricks.com/blog/2016/07/14/a-tale-of-three-apache-spark-apis-rdds-dataframes-and-datasets.html)

---

### RDD -> DataFrame

![difference-between-rdd-and-dataframe.png](img/difference-between-rdd-and-dataframe.png)

Two ways to convert RDD to DataFrame:

- Use Reflection to infer the schema of the RDD that contains specific type data.
  - Firstly define a case class. Then Spark will convert it to DataFrame implicitly.
  - This way is suitable for the RDD whose data type is known.
  - More concise code.
  - Currently (Spark 2.4), Spark SQL does not support converting JavaBeans to DataFrames that contain Map field(s).
- Use programming interface to construct a schema and apply it to an existing RDD.
  - Construct Datasets when the columns and their types are not known until runtime.
  - More verbose.
  - Steps:
    1. Create an RDD of `Rows` from the original RDD.
    2. Create the schema represented by a `StructType` matching the structure of Rows in the RDD created in Step 1.
    3. Apply the schema to the RDD of `Rows` via `createDataFrame()` method provided by `SparkSession`.

---

### Structured API Execution

Steps: 

1. Write DataFrame / Dataset / SQL Code.
2. If valid code, Spark converts this to a Logical Plan.
3. Spark transforms this Logical Plan to a Physical Plan, checking for optimizations along the way through Catalyst Optimizer.
4. Spark then executes this Physical Plan (RDD manipulations) on the cluster.

![catalyst-optimizer.png](img/catalyst-optimizer.png)

#### Logical Plan

![logical-planning-process.png](img/logical-planning-process.png)

#### Physical Plan 

![physical-planning-process.png](img/physical-planning-process.png)

#### Execution

Spark performs further optimizations at runtime, generating native Java bytecode that can remove entire tasks or stages during execution.

---

### Schema

- Schema-on-read
  - Infer schema automatically.
  - Inaccurate, precision issues.
- Define schema manually through `StructType` and `StructField`.
  - Use this in production especially for untyped sources like CSV and JSON files.

#### Column

Different ways to construct or refer a column: 

- `col("columnName")`
- `column("columnName")`
- `$"columnName"` (in Scala)
- `'columnName` (in Scala)
- `expr("columnName")` (the most flexible)

- Columns are just expressions.
- Columns and transformations of those columns compile to the same logical plan as parsed expressions. For example, `expr("columnName - 5")` = `expr("columnName") - 5`, because Spark compiles these to a logical tree specifying the order of operations.

#### Row

- Each row in a DataFrame is a single record.
- A record is an object of type Row.
- Row objects internally represent arrays of bytes. 

- Create a Row: `val myRow = Row("hello", null, 1, false)`
- Access a Row: 
  - `myRow(0)`: type Any
  - `myRow(0).asInstanceOf[String]`: type String
  - `myRow.getString(0)`: type String
  - `myRow.getInt(2)`: type Int

---

### Joins

**Partition data correctly prior to a join.**

If data from two different DataFrames is already located on the same machine, Spark can avoid the shuffle.

[SparkSQL-有必要坐下来聊聊Join](http://hbasefly.com/2017/03/19/sparksql-basic-join/?cwrmhw=4wzjj2)

Communication Strategies

- Shuffle join
  - All-to-all communication.
  - Every node talks to every other node. 
  - Expensive, especially if your data is not partitioned well.
- Broadcast join
  - Replicate the small DataFrame onto every worker node.
  - More efficient.
  - Explicitly use a broadcast join: `<df1>.join(broadcast(<df2>), <joinExpr>)`.

#### Big table–to–big table

Use shuffle join.

![join-two-big-tables.png](img/join-two-big-tables.png)

#### Big table–to–small table

Small: small enough to fit into the memory of a single worker node. 

Use broadcast join.

Steps:

1. Use broadcast variable to broadcast small table onto every node.
2. Joins will be performed on every single node individually. No further communication between nodes.

![join-big-table-and-small-table.png](img/join-big-table-and-small-table.png)

#### Small table–to–small table

It is usually best to let Spark decide how to join them.

---

### Grouping Sets

`GROUPING SETS` operator is only available in SQL.

When performing grouping sets, if you do not filter out null values, you will get incorrect results. This applies to cubes, rollups, and grouping sets.

---

### Data Sources

Six core data sources:

- csv
- json
- parquet
- orc
- jdbc/odbc connections
- plain-text files

When reading and writing, Spark will use the Parquet format **by default**.

When writing, the destination directory is actually a folder with numerous files within it, which reflects the number of partitions in our DataFrame at the time we write it out.

#### JSON

**Recommend** using line-delimited JSON format, which is much more stable than the multiline.

#### Parquet

**Recommend** writing data out to Parquet for long-term storage because reading from a Parquet file will always be **more efficient than JSON or CSV**.

Advantages: 

- Storage optimizations, **columnar** compression.
- When reading, it allows for reading individual columns instead of entire files.
- Supports complex types (array, map, struct), which would fail with a CSV file.

**Be careful** when you write out Parquet files with different versions of Spark (especially older ones) because this can cause significant headache.

#### ORC

A self-describing, type-aware **columnar** file format designed for Hadoop workloads.

- optimized for large streaming reads
- finding required rows quickly

Difference between ORC and Parquet:

- Parquet is further optimized for Spark.
- ORC is further optimized for Hive.

#### Text Files

- When reading, each line in the file becomes a record in the DataFrame.
- When writing, be sure to have only one string column; otherwise, the write will fail.

#### Advanced I/O Concepts

- **Recommend** Parquet with gzip compression.
- Multiple executors cannot read from the same file at the same time.
- By default, one file is written per partition of the data.

#### Small File Problem

When you are writing lots of small files, there is a significant metadata overhead that you incur managing all of those files.

Spark and HDFS do not work well with small files.

When writing files, you can control file sizes by controlling the number of records that are written to each file: `<columnName>.write.option("maxRecordsPerFile", <numberOfRecords>)`. 

---

## Spark SQL

- Use RDD to process text file.
- Use Spark SQL to process structured data.
- Spark SQL is intended to operate as an OLAP not OLTP.

### Spark SQL CLI

- Cannot communicate with the Thrift JDBC server.
- To start Spark SQL CLI, in terminal under the Spark directory, `./bin/spark-sql`.

---

### Spark SQL Thrift JDBC/ODBC Server

![sparkSQL-shell-access.png](img/sparkSQL-shell-access.png)

---

### Spark SQL Optimization

![spark-sql-optimization.jpg](img/spark-sql-optimization.jpg)

---

### SparkSession

From Spark 2.0, `SparkSession` interface was introduced to realize all functions of `SQLContext` and `HiveContext`.

Using `SparkSession`, you can

- load data from different data source and transfer to DataFrame.
- transfer DataFrame to table in `SQLContext`.
- use SQL statements to operate data.

#### SparkContext

SparkContext is the entry point of the SparkSession. 

SparkContext focuses on more fine-grained control of Spark’s central abstractions.

You should **not** need to explicitly initialize a SparkContext through `new SparkContext`, but use the following way:

```scala
import org.apache.spark.SparkContext
val sc = SparkContext.getOrCreate()
```

You should **rarely need to use the SparkContext.**

#### SQLContext

SQLContext focuses on the higher-level tools like Spark SQL.

You should **never need to use the SQLContext.**

---

### Spark SQL & Hive

It is compulsory to add Hive support for Spark in order to access Hive using Spark.

Pre-compile version Spark from official site generally does not contain Hive support. You need to compile the source code.

Spark SQL can connect to Hive metastores. To connect to the Hive metastore, there are several properties that you will need to specify:

- `spark.sql.hive.metastore.version`: default value is 1.2.1
- `spark.sql.hive.metastore.jars`
- `spark.sql.hive.metastore.sharedPrefixes`

---

### Catalog

The highest level abstraction in Spark SQL.

It is an abstraction for the storage of metadata about the data stored in your tables, databases, tables, functions, and views.

It is a repository of all table and DataFrame information.

---

### Tables

Core difference between tables and DataFrames:

- You define DataFrames in the scope of a programming language.
- You define tables within a database.

#### Spark-Managed Tables

- When you define a table from files on disk, you are defining an **unmanaged table**.
- When you use `saveAsTable` on a DataFrame, you are creating a **Spark-managed table**.

---

### Views

- A view specifies a set of transformations on top of an existing table. 
- It basically just saves query plans, which can be convenient for organizing or reusing your query logic.
- Spark will perform it only at query time.

---

### Aggregations

[SparkSQL 中group by、grouping sets、rollup和cube方法详解](https://www.jianshu.com/p/45cf609f5a61)

---

## Spark ML

- Machine learning algorithms in MLlib require that data is represented as numerical values. 
- All machine learning algorithms in Spark take as input a Vector type, which must be a set of numerical values. 

### ML Workflow

Steps: 

1. Data preprocessing: prepare **trainDataFrame** and **testDataFrame** based on raw data without using any ML concepts.
2. Data processing: feature engineering and get **transformation pipeline**. 
3. Prepare for training.
    1. Transformation pipeline fits trainDataFrame to get **fitted pipeline**.
    2. Fitted pipeline transforms trainDataFrame to get **transformedTraining**.
4. Cache transformedTraining.
5. Prepare for ML model.
    1. Create **untrained model**.
    2. Untrained model fits transformedTraining to get **trained model**.
    3. Trained model computes cost of transformedTraining.
6. Test.
    1. Fitted pipeline transforms testDataFrame to get **transformedTest**.
    2. Trained model computes cost of transformedTest.

Estimator receives an input DataFrame via `.fit()` method, and then generate a Transformer.

- Estimator: algorithm
- Transformer: model

![ml-workflow.png](img/ml-workflow.png)

![ml-workflow-2.png](img/ml-workflow-2.png)

- Red frame: estimator
- Blue frame: transformer

1. Create a new pipeline to fit trainingData, and then generate a pipelineModel.
2. Use this model to transform testData, and then get DataFrame with prediction.

![ml-pipeline.png](img/ml-pipeline.png)

---

### Feature Transformation

Feature transformation: transformation of label and index.

`StringIndexer`

- Construction order of the index is the frequency of label.
- When encoding labels, give priority to those with higher frequency.
- The index of the label with highest frequency is 0.

---

## Developing Spark Applications

Spark Applications are the combination of two things:

- Spark cluster
- code

### Package 

Building tools:

- sbt
- Maven

Build methods: 

- :thumbsdown: Use `sbt assemble` to build an "uber-jar" or "fat-jar" that contains all of the dependencies in one JAR. May cause complications (especially dependency conflicts).
- :thumbsup: Run `sbt package`, which will gather all of dependencies into the target folder but will not package all of them into one big JAR.

### Run

Steps:

1. Make sure there are no paths to your local file system used in your script as the file system might be HDFS or Amazon S3.
2. Package up your Scala project into a .jar file.
	- If the project has many dependencies, use sbt to package your project instead of IDE export. Then use `spark-submit <your_.jar_file>` to run **without other parameters**.
3. Use `spark-submit` to execute driver script in command line.

```
spark-submit \
--class <class_object_that_contains_your_main_function> \
--master <master_url> \ 
--deploy-mode <deploy-mode> \  # client by default
--conf <key>=<value> \
--jars <comma_seperated_list_of_paths_to_any_dependencies> \
--files <files_you_want_placed_alongside_your_application> \
<your_.jar_file> \
<main_function_args>
```

Example: 

```
$SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-submit \
--class com.databricks.example.DataFrameExample \
--master local \
target/scala-2.11/example_2.11-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar "hello"
```

You may need to specify the following parameters when running on cluster and you need to tweak them. These parameters should be pre-configured on cluster or in Spark configuration file.

- `--master`
  - `yarn`: for running a YARN /Hadoop cluster
  - `hostname:port`: for connecting to a master on a Spark standalone cluster
  - `mesos://masternode:port`
  - A master in you SparkConf or specified when `val spark`, will override this.
- `--num-executors`: must set explicitly with YARN, only 2 by default.
- `--executor-memory`: make sure you do not try to use more memory than you have. 1G by default.
- `--total-executor-cores`: applicable to Standalone/Mesos.
- `--driver-memory <driver_memory>`: 1024M by default

### Testing

What to test:

- Input data resilience
- Business logic resilience and evolution
  - **DO NOT** write a bunch of "Spark Unit Tests" that just test Spark’s functionality; instead test complex business pipeline.
- Resilience in output and atomicity
  - Most of Spark pipelines are probably feeding other Spark pipelines.
  - Ensure that downstream understands the "state" of the output data.
    - how frequently it is updated
    - whether the data is "complete"
    - any last-minute corrections to the data

How:

- Managing SparkSessions
  - Use unit test framework (e.g. JUnit or ScalaTest).
  - **Initialize the SparkSession only once** and pass it around to relevant functions and classes at runtime. 
  - Create and clean up a SparkSession for each test.
- Connecting to data sources
  - Make sure testing code does not connect to production data sources.
  - Have all business logic functions take DataFrames or Datasets as input
instead of directly connecting to various sources.
  - Load from small text file and then register some dummy datasets as table names.

Testing libraries: 

- [spark-fast-tests](https://github.com/MrPowers/spark-fast-tests)
- [spark-testing-base](https://github.com/holdenk/spark-testing-base)

### Configuring

Three ways:

- Spark properties by using a SparkConf object
- Java system properties
- Hardcoded configuration files

#### Application Properties

They define basic application metadata and some execution characteristics.

You can set through (precedence from high to low): 

- when creating the Spark application, `SparkConf`, for instance: 

```scala
val spark = SparkSession.builder
.master("local[*]")
.appName("my app")
.config("<property>", "<value>")
.getOrCreate()
```

- from `spark-submit` or `spark-shell`
- in "conf/spark-defaults.conf" file

You can ensure that you have correctly set application properties by checking the application’s web UI on port 4040 of the driver on the "Environment" tab.

#### Execution Properties

most relevant

finer-grained control on actual execution

The most common configurations: 

- `spark.executor.cores`
- `spark.files.maxPartitionBytes`

#### Environmental Variables

They are used to configure certain Spark settings.

- Standalone and Mesos modes, in "conf/spark-env.sh" file.
- On YARN in cluster mode, use `spark.yarn.appMasterEnv.[EnvironmentVariableName]` property in "conf/spark-defaults.conf" file. But "conf/spark-env.sh" file does not work.

#### Job Scheduling

Within a given Spark Application, multiple parallel jobs can run simultaneously if they were submitted from separate threads.

Spark’s scheduler is fully thread-safe. 

- By default, Spark’s scheduler runs jobs in FIFO fashion.
- **Fair scheduler**: Spark assigns tasks between jobs in a round-robin fashion so that all jobs get a roughly equal share of cluster resources. 
  - **Best** for multiuser settings. 
  - Set `spark.scheduler.mode` property to `FAIR`.
  - Group jobs into pools, and set different scheduling options, or weights, for each pool.
    - Create a high-priority pool for more important jobs.
    - Group the jobs of each user together and give users equal shares.
    - Set job pools for per thread: `spark.sparkContext.setLocalProperty("spark.scheduler.pool", "<pool_name>")`. Clear the pool, set it to `null`.

#### Application Scheduling

If multiple users share your cluster and run different Spark applications, different options to manage allocation: 

##### Static Allocation 

Each application is given a maximum amount of resources, and holds onto those resources for the entire duration.

- simplest option 
- available on all cluster managers

##### Dynamic Allocation

Dynamically adjust the resources your application occupies based on the workload.

- available on all coarse-grained cluster managers: standalone, YARN, and Mesos coarse-grained mode
- disabled by default

Steps to use:

1. Set `spark.dynamicAllocation.enabled` to true.
2. Set up an external shuffle service on each worker node in the same cluster.
3. Set `spark.shuffle.service.enabled` to true.

The external shuffle service is to allow executors to be removed without deleting shuffle files written by them.

---

## Deploying Spark 

### Execution Modes

[Spark Modes of Deployment – Cluster Mode and Client Mode](https://techvidvan.com/tutorials/spark-modes-of-deployment/)

#### Cluster Mode

- The most commonly used.
- Spark driver process runs on a worker node inside the cluster.
- Reduces chance of network disconnection between "driver" and "spark infrastructure", then reduces the chance of job failure.
- Cluster manager is responsible for maintaining all Spark Application–related processes.
- Client can exit after creating the Spark application.
- Libraries and external jars must be distributed manually or through the `--jars` command-line argument.

When to use:

When job submitting machine is remote from "spark infrastructure". Since, within "spark infrastructure", "driver" component will be running. Thus, it reduces data movement between job submitting machine and "spark infrastructure". In such case, This mode works totally fine.

#### Client Mode 

- Spark driver remains on the client machine that submitted the application.
- Client machine is responsible for maintaining the Spark driver process.

When to use:

When job submitting machine is within or near to "spark infrastructure". Since there is no high network latency of data movement for final result generation between "spark infrastructure" and "driver", then, this mode works very fine.

#### Local Mode

- Runs the entire Spark Application on a single machine.
- Achieves parallelism through threads on that single machine.
- Used for learning and testing.

### Where to Deploy

- on-premises cluster
- public cloud

#### On-Premises Cluster

Pros: 

- Full control.
- You can optimize performance for your specific workload.

Cons: 

- Cluster is fixed in size. This is adverse when it comes to data analytics workloads like Spark, which are elastic.
  - Solution: Use a cluster manager that allows you to run many Spark applications and dynamically reassign resources between them, or even allows non-Spark applications on the same cluster. (Yarn, Mesos)
- You need to select and operate your own storage system, (e.g. HDFS and Apache Cassandra), which includes setting up georeplication and disaster recovery if required.
  - When selecting, recommend evaluating the performance of its Spark connector and evaluating the available management tools.

#### Public Cloud

Pros: 

- Resources are elastic.
- Low-cost, georeplicated storage is included.
  - All major cloud providers include managed Hadoop clusters for their customers, which provide HDFS for storage as well as Apache Spark. This is actually **NOT** a great way to run Spark in the cloud.
  - Instead,** better to decouple computing and storage**. Use global storage systems that are decoupled from a specific cluster, such as Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage, or Google Cloud Storage. You will be able to pay for computing resources only when needed, scale them up dynamically, and mix different hardware types.
  - Do not need to migrating an on-premises installation to virtual machines, instead you can run Spark natively against cloud storage.
  - Several companies provide "cloud-native" Spark-based services, e.g. Databricks. 

### Cluster Managers

#### Standalone

A lightweight platform built specifically for Apache Spark workloads. 

Cons: 

- Your cluster can only run Spark.

Two ways to start the cluster: 

- by hand
- using built-in scripts

#### Yarn

Spark will find the YARN configuration files using the environment variable `HADOOP_CONF_DIR` or `YARN_CONF_DIR`.

`spark-submit --master yarn`

**Best practice** of Hadoop configurations: 

Include two Hadoop configuration files on Spark’s classpath by setting `HADOOP_CONF_DIR` in $SPARK_HOME/spark-env.sh to a location containing the configuration files. 
  - hdfs-site.xml
  - core-site.xml

Pros:

- Great for HDFS-based applications.

Cons:

- Not commonly used for much else.
- Not well designed to support the cloud.
- Compute and storage is largely coupled together.

#### Mesos

Apache Mesos abstracts CPU, memory, storage, and other compute resources away from machines (physical or virtual).

- The heaviest-weight cluster manager.
- Intends to be a datacenter scale-cluster manager.
- Use it **ONLY IF** your organization already has a large-scale deployment of Mesos.
- Supports a wide range of application types.

Coarse-grained mode: each Spark executor runs as a single Mesos task.

Fine-grained mode: deprecated.

## Monitoring and Debugging

**Components you can monitor:** 

- Spark Applications and Jobs (RDDs and query plans)
  - tools:    
    - Spark UI
    - Spark logs
- JVM
  - JVM utilities: 
    - jstack
    - jmap
    - jstat
    - jconsole
    - jvisualvm
- OS/Machine (CPU, network, I/O)
  - tools: 
    - dstat
    - iostat
    - iotop
- Cluster
  - cluster-level monitoring tools:
    - Ganglia
    - Prometheus

**Two main things to monitor:** 

- processes
  - driver (most important)
  - executors (2nd most important)
- queries
  - jobs
  - stages
  - tasks

---

### Spark Logs

It can help you know where jobs are failing or what is causing that failure.

Python will **not** be able to integrate directly with Spark’s Java-based logging library.

Change Spark's log level: `spark.sparkContext.setLogLevel("INFO")`.

- Local mode: print logs to standard error.
- Cluster mode: save to files by cluster manager. (typically, through cluster manager's web UI to find these log files)

---

### Spark UI

Monitor applications at the Spark and JVM level.

a SparkContext - a web UI

- default port 4040
- multiple applications, increase port numbers: 4041, 4042 ... 

#### Blue Boxes

- Exchange - shuffle, e.g. repartition
- Project - e.g. selecting/adding/filtering columns

#### Spark History Server

Used to reconstruct the Spark UI and REST API after your application crashes or ends.

First need to configure the application to save an event log. 

- Configure `spark.eventLog.enable`.
- Configure the event log location `spark.eventLog.dir`.

---

### Debugging and Spark First Aid

#### Debug Steps

1. Add logging statements to figure out where your job is crashing and what type of data arrives at each stage.
2. Isolate the problem to the smallest piece of code possible.
3. For data skew issues, use Spark’s UI to get a quick overview of how much work each task is doing.

#### Spark Jobs Not Starting

**Signs and symptoms:**

- Spark jobs do not start.
- The Spark UI does not show any nodes on the cluster except the driver.
- The Spark UI seems to be reporting incorrect information.

**Possible causes:**

- The cluster or application’s resource demands are not configured properly. Then the node that runs the driver cannot talk to the executors.
- You did not specify what IP and port is open or did not open the correct one.
- The application requested more resources (e.g. memory) per executor than your cluster manager currently has free, in which case the driver will be waiting forever for executors to be launched.

**Potential treatments:**

- You should open up all ports between the worker nodes unless you have more stringent security constraints.
- Ensure that your Spark resource configurations are correct and that your cluster manager is properly set up for Spark. Try running a simple application first to see if that works.

#### Slow Tasks or Stragglers

One of the most difficult issues to debug, because of so many possible causes.

**Signs and symptoms:**

- Spark stages seem to execute until there are only a handful of tasks left. Those tasks then take a long time.
- These slow tasks show up in the Spark UI and occur consistently on the same dataset(s).
- These occur in stages, one after the other.
- Scaling up the number of machines given to the Spark Application does not really help — some tasks still take much longer than others.
- In the Spark metrics, certain executors are reading and writing much more data than others.

**Possible causes:**

- Data skew.
- Hardware problem.
- Most often, data is partitioned unevenly. (e.g. partitioning by a skewed ID column, or a column where many values are null)
- You use a group-by-key operation and one of the keys just has more data than others. In Spark UI, the shuffle data for some nodes is much larger than for others.
- When working with Datasets, a lot of object instantiation causes a lot of garbage collection.

**Potential treatments:**

- Try increasing the number of partitions.
- Try repartitioning by another combination of columns.
- First filter out the null values.
- Try increasing the memory of executors.
- Monitor the executor which might be unhealthy.
- Check whether UDFs are wasteful in their object allocation or business logic. Try to convert them to DataFrame code if possible.
- Ensure that UDFs or UDAFs are running on a small enough batch of data.
- Turning on speculation through setting `spark.speculation` to true.
- Look at the garbage collection metrics in the Spark UI to see if they are consistent with the slow tasks.
- Check the Spark UI for imbalanced amounts of data across tasks.

#### Driver OutOfMemoryError or Driver Unresponsive

serious issue

**Signs and symptoms:**

- Spark Application is unresponsive or crashed.
- OutOfMemoryErrors or garbage collection messages in the driver logs.
- Commands take a very long time to run or do not run at all.
- Interactivity is very low or non-existent.
- Memory usage is high for the driver JVM.

**Possible causes:**

- Use `collect` to collect overly large dataset to the driver node.
- The data to be broadcast is too big when using a broadcast join.
- A long-running application generated a large number of objects on the driver and is unable to
release them.
- When using Python, data conversion requires too much memory in the JVM. 
- Share a SparkContext with other users.

**Potential treatments:**

- Use Spark’s maximum broadcast join configuration to better control the size it will broadcast.
- Use jmap tool to see what objects are filling most of the memory of your driver JVM by printing a histogram of the heap. **NOTE** that jmap will pause that JVM while running.
- Increase the driver’s memory.
- Write data to a file instead of bringing it back as in-memory objects.

#### Executor OutOfMemoryError or Executor Unresponsive

**Signs and symptoms:**

- OutOfMemoryErrors or garbage collection messages in the executor logs. You can find these in the Spark UI.
- Executors that crash or become unresponsive.
- Slow tasks on certain nodes that never seem to recover.

**Possible causes:**

- Some of the tasks, especially UDFs, create lots of objects that need to be garbage collected.

**Potential treatments:**

- Try increasing the memory available to executors and the number of executors.
- Repartition data to increase parallelism, and reduce the amount of records per task.
- Ensure that null values are handled correctly instead of default value like " " or "EMPTY".
- Use fewer UDFs and more of Spark’s structured operations. 
- Use jmap tool to get a histogram of heap memory usage on your executors, and see which classes are taking up the most space.
- Isolate Spark jobs from other jobs if executors are being placed on nodes that also have other workloads.

## GraphX

GraphX is a new component in Spark for graphs and graph-parallel computation. GraphX extends the Spark RDD by introducing a new Graph abstraction: a directed multigraph with properties attached to each vertex and edge.

Multigraph: Graph with potentially multiple parallel edges sharing the same source and destination vertex. 

Parallel edges: Multiple relationships (e.g. co-worker and friend) between the same vertices.

### Basics 

#### Property Graphs

Each vertex is keyed by a unique 64-bit long identifier (VertexId). 

GraphX optimizes the representation of vertex and edge types when they are primitive data types (e.g., int, double, etc…) reducing the in memory footprint by storing them in specialized arrays.

Property graphs are immutable, distributed, and fault-tolerant.

The graph is partitioned across the executors using a range of vertex partitioning heuristics.

The graph class contains members to access the vertices and edges of the graph: 

```scala
class Graph[VD, ED] {
  val vertices: VertexRDD[VD]
  val edges: EdgeRDD[ED]
}
```

#### Vertex RDDs

`VertexRDD[VD]` extends `RDD[(VertexId, VD)]` and represents a set of vertices each with an attribute of type `VD`. 

Internally, vertex attributes are stored in a reusable hash-map data-structure. As a consequence if two `VertexRDD`s are derived from the same base `VertexRDD` (e.g., by `filter` or `mapValues`) they can be joined in constant time without hash evaluations. (**index reuse**, fast)

#### Edge RDDs

`EdgeRDD[ED]` extends `RDD[Edge[ED]]` and organizes the edges in blocks partitioned using one of the various partitioning strategies defined in `PartitionStrategy`. 

Within each partition, edge attributes and adjacency structure, are stored separately enabling maximum **reuse** when changing attribute values.

---

### Optimized Representation

GraphX partitions the graph along vertices which can reduce both the communication and storage overhead.

![vertex-cut.png](img/vertex-cut.png)

It assigns edges to machines and allows vertices to span multiple machines. The exact method of assigning edges depends on the `PartitionStrategy`.

Users can choose between different strategies by repartitioning the graph with the `Graph.partitionBy` operator. 

The `groupEdges` operator merges parallel edges (i.e., duplicate edges between pairs of vertices) in the multigraph. 

You must call `Graph.partitionBy` before calling `Graph.groupEdges` because it requires the graph to be repartitioned and it assumes identical edges will be colocated on the same partition.

---

## System Scaling

### Scale Kafka Connect  

- Configure `tasks.max` to number of tables/files.  
- Create different instances for different tables/files.  
- Increase frequency of polling.  
- Use Kafka Connect in cluster mode.  

### Scale Kafka Broker  

- Create multiple partitions for each topic.  
- Increase nodes in the cluster.  

### Scale Spark Streaming  

- Have a single instance of the drive program with separate threads for each stream in the driver.  
- Create separate driver instances for each stream.
- Spark cluster – add nodes.  

### Scale MySQL

- Keep table size small, thereby keeping the entire table in memory, which makes updates and querying very quick.
- Use distributed databases with a lot of nodes that are good for frequent updates – e.g. Cassandra.

## Glossary

- **Avro**: Avro format is great for **row oriented data**. The schema is stored in another file.
- **Parquet**: It is a very efficient format. Generally, you take .csv or .json files. Then do ETL. Then write down to parquet files for future analysis. Parquet is great for **column oriented data**. The schema is in the file.

## Reasons for Using Spark

- Spark's simple, robust programming model makes it easy to apply to a large number of problems. 
- There are also a lot of packages created by Spark community.

### `spark-shell`

```scala
// in spark shell

val intArray = Array(1,2,3)
val intRDD = sc.parallelize(intArray)
intRDD.first
intRDD.take(2)
intRDD.collect
intRDD.collect.foreach(println)
intRDD.partitions.size  // get number of partitions of intRDD


val intList = List(1,2,3,4)
val intListRDD = sc.parallelize(intList, 10)  // specify number of partitions as 10 instead of the default


val fileRDD = sc.textFile("/Users/zhanli/spark/README.md")
fileRDD.first
fileRDD.take(3)
fileRDD.take(3).foreach(println)


val data = Array(
     | "This is line one",
     | "This is line two",
     | "This is line three",
     | "This is the last line")
val dataRDD = sc.parallelize(data)
val filterRDD = dataRDD.filter(line => line.length > 15)
filterRDD.collect.foreach(println)
val mapRDD = dataRDD.map(line => line.split(" "))
mapRDD.collect  // return type: Array[Array[String]]
val flatMapRDD = dataRDD.flatMap(line => line.split(" "))
flatMapRDD.collect  // return type: Array[String]


val numArray = Array(1,1,2,2,3,3,4)
val numRDD = sc.parallelize(numArray)
val distinctElementsRDD = numRDD.distinct
distinctElementsRDD.collect
```

### RDD 

- Get keys of RDD: `<rdd_var>.keys`
- Get values of RDD: `<rdd_var>.values`
- Sort RDD by key: `<rdd_var>.sortByKey()`
  - Ascending is default.
  - Descending: `<rdd_var>.sortByKey(false)`
- Sort RDD: `<rdd_var>.sortBy(<sort_accordance>)`
  - E.g. according to the second element of tuple in descending: `<rdd_var>.sortBy(_._2, false)`
- Only do mapping for RDD values: `<rdd_var>.mapValues(<func>)`
  - E.g. add 1 for values only: `<rdd_var>.mapValues(_ + 1)`
- Join two RDDs with the same key: `<rdd_var1>.join(<rdd_var2>)`
  - E.g. `(k, v1).join(k, v2)` Then you will get `(k, (v1, v2))`.
- Create a new key for RDD: `<rdd_var>.keyBy(<func>)`
  - E.g. `<rdd_var>.keyBy(<tuple> => <tuple._1>)`

### DataFrame

- `myDF.show()`
- `myDF.select("someFieldName")`
- `myDF.filter(myDF("someFieldName") > 200)`
- `myDF.groupBy(myDF("someFieldName")).mean()`
- `myDF.rdd().map(<mapperFunction>)`
- `df.describe().show()`: **fast summary statistics for non-null values.**
- `df.where("<column_name> = true")` is equivalent to `df.filter($"<column_name>" === true)`

**Problem 1**: Given two dataframes aDF and bDF: key is line and value is file name, e.g. (line, a). The aim is to deduplicate lines after union a and b. 

Solution i: 

```scala
val cDF = aDF.unionAll(bDF)
cDF.dropDuplicates(col("line")).show()
```

Solution ii: 

```scala
val cDF = aDF.select("line").except(bDF.select("line")).withColumn("fileName")

aDF.union(cDF).show()
```

`unionAll()` was deprecated in Spark 2.0, and for all future reference, `union()` is the only recommended method. In either case, `union` or `unionAll`, both do not do a SQL style deduplication of data. In order to remove any duplicate rows, just use `union()` followed by a `distinct()`. 

### Pivot

![pivot.png](img/pivot.png)

```scala
val pivotedDF: DataFrame = df.groupBy("id")
      .pivot("type", Seq("t1", "t2"))  // Seq("ti", "t2") is optional. Having it is better for performance if you know all values of column "type".
      .agg(first("value"))
```

#### Complex Pivot

![complex-pivot.png](img/complex-pivot.png)

```scala
val complexPivotedDF: DataFrame = df2.groupBy("id")
  .pivot("type", Seq("t1", "t2"))
  .agg(first("value").as("value"),
    first("value2").as("value2")
    )
```

#### Pivot List

![pivot-list.png](img/pivot-list.png)

```scala
val window = Window.partitionBy("id").orderBy("ranking_num")

val pivotListedDF: DataFrame = df3
  .withColumn("ranking_num", $"ranking".cast(IntegerType))
  .withColumn("value_list_sorted_by_ranking", collect_list("value").over(window))
  .groupBy("id")
  .agg(max("value_list_sorted_by_ranking").as("value_list"))
```

#### Pivot Consolidate

![pivot-consolidate.png](img/pivot-consolidate.png)

```scala
val window = Window.partitionBy("id", "type").orderBy("ranking_num")

val pivotConsolidatedDF: DataFrame = df4
  .withColumn("ranking_num", $"ranking".cast(IntegerType))
  .withColumn("value_list_sorted_by_ranking", collect_list("value").over(window))
  .groupBy("id", "type")
  .agg(max("value_list_sorted_by_ranking").as("value_list"))
  .groupBy("id")
  .pivot("type", Seq("a", "b"))
  .agg(first("value_list"))
```

### Null Value

Add a new string type column to dataframe with null value: `df.withColumn("columnName", lit(null).cast("string"))`

### UDF

```scala
val myUDF = (x => <userDefinedFunction>)
val myNewDF = myDF.withColumn("newColumnName", myUDF('columnName'))
```

### `import spark.implicits._`

When to use:

- when using `$<columnName>` to convert a string to a column.

### Scala Object VS Scala App

When coding in IDE, you will be choosing to create a Scala Object or a Scala App under a package.

- Scala Object
  - With main function.
  - You are able to specify input parameters when executing the program.

- Scala App
  - Extends `App`.
  - Without main function.

### Read Files

#### Read CSV File as Dataset

When reading a CSV file as a Dataset with a case class, make sure headers of the CSV file matches fields of the case class. If they are not the same, use code to modify the header after converting the CSV file to DataFrame, e.g. removing spaces and lowering case the first character, and then convert to Dataset.   

By default, every column in a CSV file is treated as a string type, and the column
names default to `_c0`, `_c1`, `_c2`, … 

For instance, 

```scala
val df = spark.read.
    .option("header", true)
    .option("inferSchema", true)
    .option("nullValue", "?")  // declares that "?" in the file represents a null value
    .csv("/file/path")
```

### Write Files

By default, Spark will throw an error if you try to save a data frame to a file that
already exists.

You can control Spark's behavior by specifying `SaveMode`:

- `Overwrite`
- `Append`
- `Ignore`

For instance, `df.write.mode(SaveMode.Ignore).parquet("file.parquet")`

### Running on Cluster

Take Amazon EMR (Elastic MapReduce) as an example.

#### Best Practice

- If **executors start failing**, you may need to adjust the memory each executor has from the master node. `spark-submit --executor-memory 1g <your .jar file>`
- If something **timed out** or **heartbeat failed**, it indicates your cluster is not big enough (hardware aspect) or you did not partition your job well.
	- (Try 1st) Use `partitionBy()` to demand less work from each executor by using smaller partitions.
	- (2nd) Each executor may need more memory.
	- (3rd) You may need more machines (capacity) in your cluster.
- Try to keep dependencies (packages) to a minimum.
	- If you only need to write several more lines of code, **DO NOT** import a new package.
	- Time is money on your cluster.

#### Steps

1. Get your scripts and data someplace where EMR can access them easily.
	- AWS's S3 is a good choice. Use `s3n://<file_path>` when specifying file paths, and make sure your file permissions make them accessible.
2. Start Spark on AWS.
3. Get the external DNS name for the master node, and log into it using user account and private key file.
4. Copy driver program's .jar file and any other files it needs to the master node using `aws s3 cp s3://<bucket_name>/<file_name> ./`.
5. Run `spark-submit`.
6. Terminate your cluster when you are done.

### Tips

- **DO NOT** recommend using `toDF` on `Seq` type for production, because it allows columns to be null. If you do not want this, there will be problems. 
    - E.g. `val myDF = Seq(("Hello", 2, 1L)).toDF("col1", "col2", "col3")`.
- Spark’s TimestampType class supports only second-level precision. If you are going to be working with milliseconds, use `LongType`.
- **Recommend** parsing dates, timestamps and nulls explicitly instead of relying on implicit conversions.
- **When performing grouping sets, if you do not filter out null values, you will get incorrect results.** This applies to cubes, rollups, and grouping sets.
- When joing two dataframes using `Seq`, e.g. `val resultDF = df1.join(df2, Seq("colA"))`, only `colA` in `df1` will be kept in `resultDF`, `colA` in `df2` will not.
- Check if a DataFrame is empty: `df.head(1).isEmpty`

#### Count

- Show all rows of a DataFrame in the console instead of only 20 rows by default: `df.show(df.count().toInt)`.
- When performing calculations over big data, it can be quite expensive to get an exact answer to a question, and it is often much cheaper to simply request an approximate to a reasonable degree of accuracy. E.g. `approx_count_distinct("<column_name>", <max_estimation_percentage_error_allowed>)`.
- `count(*)` will count null values (including rows containing all nulls). `count("<columnName>")` will not count null values.
- Two ways to perform count:
    - count method - action - return result immediately
    - count function in `agg()` method - transformation - lazy evaluation (**prefer this one**)
- `rdd.countByValue()` loads the result set into the memory of the driver. Use this method **only** if the resulting map is expected to be small, such as the total number of rows is low or the number of distinct items is low.

#### Null Values

- Use nulls to represent missing or empty data in DataFrames, because Spark can optimize working with null values more than it can if you use empty strings or other values.
- Use `asc_nulls_first`, `desc_nulls_first`, `asc_nulls_last`, or `desc_nulls_last` to specify where you would like your null values to appear in an ordered DataFrame.

Two things you can do with null values:

- explicitly drop nulls
- fill them with a value (globally or on a per-column basis)

#### Optimization

- When reading a csv file as DataFrame, if you can know the schema ahead of time and **use `StructType` rather than `option("inferSchema", "true")`**, there will be a significant performance benefit **when the data set is very large**, since Spark will not need to perform an extra pass over the data to figure out the data type of each column.

# High Performance Spark Note

Spark version 2.0.1. 

## How Spark Works

Three major features:

- lazy evaluation
- in-memory computation / persistence
- immutability

Using the Standalone manager requires installing Spark on each node of the cluster.

Spark SQL is a very important component for Spark performance.

Spark ML provides a higher-level API than MLlib. Spark MLlib is primarily built on top of RDDs and uses functions from Spark Core, while ML is built on top of Spark SQL DataFrames. Eventually, MLlib -> ML.

Actions trigger the scheduler, which builds a DAG.

### Lazy Evaluation

**Not all transformations are 100% lazy.** `sortByKey` needs to evaluate the RDD to determine the range of data, so it involves both a transformation and an action. 

Most distributed computing paradigms that allow users to work with **mutable** objects provide fault tolerance by logging updates or duplicating data across machines.

The RDD itself contains all the dependency information needed to replicate each of its partitions. Thus, if a partition is lost, the RDD has enough information about its lineage to recompute it, and that computation can be parallelized to make recovery faster.

Word count example with stop words (words that you do not want to count) filtered:

```scala
def wordCountWithStopWordsFiltered(rdd: RDD[String], illegalTokens: Array[Char], stopWords: Set[String]): RDD[(String, Int)] = {
    val separators = illegalTokens ++ Array[Char](" ")
    val tokens: RDD[String] = rdd.filterMap(_.split(separators).map(_.trim.toLowerCase))
    val words = tokens.filter(token => !stopWords.contains(token) && (token.length > 0))
    val wordPairs = words.map((_, 1))
    val wordCounts = wordPairs.reduceByKey(_ + _)
    wordCounts
}
```

### In-Memory Persistence and Memory Management

Compared with MapReduce, the performance increase of Spark is due to its in-memory persistence. 

Three options for memory management: 

- in-memory as deserialized data
  - Fastest but may not be the most memory efficient.
  - Default for `persist()` function.
- in-memory as serialized data.
  - Slower, more CPU-intensive, but more memory efficient.
  - Kyro is better than Java serialization.
- on disk
  - More fault-tolerant for long sequences of transformations and feasible for enormous computations.

When persisting RDDs and the memory space is not enough, by default, use **LRU caching**. But you can change the priority with `persistencePriority()` function in RDD class.

### RDD

RDDs can be created in 3 ways:

- by transforming an existing RDD.
- using a `SparkContext` from a local Scala object (using the `makeRDD` or `parallelize` methods).
- converting a DataFrame or Dataset.

Spark uses 5 main properties to represent an RDD: 

- the list of partition objects that make up the RDD. (required) - `partitions()`
- a function for computing an iterator of each partition. (required) - `iterator(p, parentIters)` (p: partition)
- a list of dependencies on other RDDs. (required) - `dependencies()`
- a partitioner (optional) - `partitioner()`
- a list of preferred locations for the HDFS file (optional) - `preferredLocations(p)` (p: partition), returns a sequence of strings, each of which is the Hadoop name of the node where that partition is stored.

As an end user, you will **rarely** need these 5 properties.

Types of RDDs: 

- `PairRDDFunctions` 
- `OrderedRDDFunctions` 
- `GroupedRDDFunctions`
- `NewHadoopRDD`
- `ShuffledRDD`

Find out what type an RDD is by using the `toDebugString` function of RDDs.

#### Actions

- Actions bring information back to the driver including `collect`, `count`, `collectAsMap`, `sample`, `reduce`, and `take`. **Best practice**: use actions like `take`, `count`, and `reduce`, which bring back a fixed amount of data to the driver.
- Actions write the data to stable storage including `saveAsTextFile`, `saveAsSequenceFile`, and
`saveAsObjectFile`.
- Functions that return nothing, such as `foreach`, are also actions.

#### Transformations

Most of the power of the Spark API is in its transformations.

Spark transformations are **coarse-grained**.

---

## Spark Tuning

Most Spark settings can only be adjusted at the application level.

**Spark’s default settings** are designed to make sure that jobs can be submitted on very small clusters, and are **not recommended for production**.

Using fewer, larger executors may prevent OOM failure.
