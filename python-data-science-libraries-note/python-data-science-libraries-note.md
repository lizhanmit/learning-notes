## NumPy

[Brush up](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/quickstart.html)

- ndarray
- Given two lists, use NumPy to do element-wise calculations. 
- Do not need to iterate the list. You can operate all elements based on array.

```python
# import module
import numpy as np

# transfer a list to a numpy array 
array_name = np.array(list_name)

# subsetting 
# get elements that are greater than 10 
subset_array_name = array_name[array_name > 10]
```

---

## Pandas 

[Brush up](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/10min.html) 

[Cheat sheet](https://pandas.pydata.org/Pandas_Cheat_Sheet.pdf)

### Basic Concepts

A `DataFrame` is a table. 

An `entry` is a cell. 

```python
import pandas as pd

# create a DataFrame
pd.DataFrame({
  'Bob': ['I liked it.', 'It was awful.'], 
  'Sue': ['Pretty good.', 'Bland.']
  },
  index=['Product A', 'Product B'])
```

|   | Bob  | Sue  |
|---|---|---|
| Product A  | I liked it.  | Pretty good.  |
| Product B  | It was awful.  | Bland.  |

Column labels: "Bob", "Sue"

Row labels: "Product A", "Product B"

Index: The list of row labels used in a DataFrame.

If you do not specify index explicitly, it would be 0, 1, 2, 3 ...

A `Series` is a list, or basically a single column in a DataFrame. 

```python
# create a Series
pd.Series([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# result: 
# 0    1
# 1    2
# 2    3
# 3    4
# 4    5
# dtype: int64
```

A Series does not have a column name, it only has one overall name.

```python
pd.Series([30, 35, 40], index=['2015 Sales', '2016 Sales', '2017 Sales'], name='Product A')

# result: 
# 2015 Sales    30
# 2016 Sales    35
# 2017 Sales    40
# Name: Product A, dtype: int64
```

### Read Data Files

```python
# read a csv file
wine_reviews = pd.read_csv("../input/wine-reviews/winemag-data-130k-v2.csv")

# use parameter "index_col" to specify index column in the csv file
wine_reviews = pd.read_csv("../input/wine-reviews/winemag-data-130k-v2.csv", index_col=0)
```

By default, `pd.read_excel()` loads the first sheet of an Excel spreadsheet.

### Indexing and Selecting

#### Python Native Accessor

Indexing operator: `[]`

```python
# select a specific Series out of a DataFrame
wine_reviews.country
# or
wine_reviews['country']

# result:
# 0            Italy
# 1         Portugal
#             ...   
# 129969      France
# 129970      France
# Name: country, Length: 129971, dtype: object

# select a specific value of a cell
wine_reviews['country'][0]

# result:
# 'Italy'
```

#### Pandas Accessor

Both `loc` and `iloc` are row-first, column-second. This is the opposite of what we do in native Python, which is column-first, row-second.

##### Index-based Selection: `iloc`

```python
# select the first row of data in a DataFrame
wine_reviews.iloc[0]

# result:
# country                                                    Italy
# description    Aromas include tropical fruit, broom, brimston...
#                                      ...                        
# variety                                              White Blend
# winery                                                   Nicosia
# Name: 0, Length: 13, dtype: object

# select the first column
# ":" operator means everything
wine_reviews.iloc[:, 0]

# result:
# 0            Italy
# 1         Portugal
#             ...   
# 129969      France
# 129970      France
# Name: country, Length: 129971, dtype: object

# select the first 3 rows of the first column 
wine_reviews[:3, 0]

# result:
# 0       Italy
# 1    Portugal
# 2          US
# Name: country, dtype: object

# select the second and third row of the first column
wine_reviews[1:3, 0]

# result:
# 1    Portugal
# 2          US
# Name: country, dtype: object

# select the first, second and third row of the first column
wine_reviews[[0, 1, 2], 0]

# select the last 5 rows
wine_reviews[-5:]
```

##### Label-based Selection: `loc`

```python
# select the row with index 0 and column "country"
wine_reviews.loc[0, 'country']

# result:
# 'Italy'

# select column 'taster_name', 'taster_twitter_handle', 'points'
wine_reviews.loc[:, ['taster_name', 'taster_twitter_handle', 'points']]
```

##### Diff between `iloc` and `loc`

`iloc`: The first element of the range is included and the last one excluded. `0:10` will select entries 0,...,9.

`loc`: Both the first and the last element are included. `0:10` will select entries 0,...,10.  

#### Manipulate Index

Index is mutable. 

Set index to column "title": `wine_reviews.set_index('title')`

#### Conditional Selection

```python
# filter country is "Italy"
wine_reviews.loc[wine_reviews.country == 'Italy']

# filter country is "Italy" and points >= 90
wine_reviews.loc[(wine_reviews.country == 'Italy') & (wine_reviews.points >= 90)]

# filter country is "Italy" or "France"
wine_reviews.loc[wine_reviews.country.isin(['Italy', 'France'])]

# filter price is not null
wine_reviews.loc[wine_reviews.price.notnull()]

# filter price is null
wine_reviews.loc[wine_reviews.price.isnull()]
```

### Assign Data

```python
# create a new column with a constant value
wine_reviews['critic'] = 'everyone'

wine_reviews['critic']

# result:
# 0         everyone
# 1         everyone
#             ...   
# 129969    everyone
# 129970    everyone
# Name: critic, Length: 129971, dtype: object

# create a new column with an iterable of values
wine_reviews['index_backwards'] = range(len(wine_reviews), 0, -1)

wine_reviews['index_backwards']

# result:
# 0         129971
# 1         129970
#            ...  
# 129969         2
# 129970         1
# Name: index_backwards, Length: 129971, dtype: int64
```

### Summary Functions

```python
# check how large the DataFrame is
df.shape

# result: 
# (number_of_rows, number_of_columns)

# show the first 5 rows of a DataFrame
df.head()

# show the first n rows of a DataFrame
df.head(n)

# get a high-level summary of the attributes of a column
# "points" is a column name
wine_reviews.points.describe()

# result:
# count    129971.000000
# mean         88.447138
#              ...      
# 75%          91.000000
# max         100.000000
# Name: points, Length: 8, dtype: float64

# get the mean of a column
wine_reviews.points.mean()

# result:
# 88.44713820775404

# get a list of unique values of a column
wine_reviews.taster_name.unique()

# result:
# array(['Kerin Oâ€™Keefe', 'Roger Voss', 'Paul Gregutt',
#        'Alexander Peartree', 'Michael Schachner', 'Anna Lee C. Iijima',
#        'Virginie Boone', 'Matt Kettmann', nan, 'Sean P. Sullivan',
#        'Jim Gordon', 'Joe Czerwinski', 'Anne Krebiehl\xa0MW',
#        'Lauren Buzzeo', 'Mike DeSimone', 'Jeff Jenssen',
#        'Susan Kostrzewa', 'Carrie Dykes', 'Fiona Adams',
#        'Christina Pickard'], dtype=object)

# get count of unique values of a column
wine_reviews.taster_name.value_counts()

# result:
# Roger Voss           25514
# Michael Schachner    15134
#                      ...  
# Fiona Adams             27
# Christina Pickard        6
# Name: taster_name, Length: 19, dtype: int64
```

### Mapping Operations 

`map()` method is similar to the one in Spark. It takes one set of values and "maps" them to another set of values.

```python
# remean column "points": use each value of column "points" to minus the mean of all values
wine_reviews_points_mean = wine_reviews.points.mean()
wine_reviews.points.map(lambda p: p - wine_reviews_points_mean)

# result:
# 0        -1.447138
# 1        -1.447138
#             ...   
# 129969    1.552862
# 129970    1.552862
# Name: points, Length: 129971, dtype: float64
```

If you want to transform a whole DataFrame instead a Series by calling a custom method on each row, use `apply()`.

```python
def remean_points(row): 
  row.points = row.points - wine_reviews_points_mean
  return row

wine_reviews.apply(remean_points, axis = 'columns')
```

**NOTE** that `map()` and `apply()` return new, transformed Series and DataFrames, respectively. They do not modify the original data they are called on. 

#### Built-ins

Pandas provides many common mapping operations as built-ins. These operators are **faster** than `map()` or `apply()` because they uses speed ups built into Pandas.

```python
# remean column "points"
wine_reviews.points - wine_reviews_points_mean

# result:
# 0        -1.447138
# 1        -1.447138
#             ...   
# 129969    1.552862
# 129970    1.552862
# Name: points, Length: 129971, dtype: float64

# combine country and region info
wine_reviews.country + ' - ' + wine_reviews.region_1

# result:
# 0            Italy - Etna
# 1                     NaN
#                ...       
# 129969    France - Alsace
# 129970    France - Alsace
# Length: 129971, dtype: object
```

However, they are not as flexible as `map()` or `apply()`, which can do more advanced things, like applying conditional logic.

### Grouping 

You can think of each group as being a slice of the DataFrame containing only data with values that match.

For the result of grouping, the order of the rows is dependent on the values in the index, not in the data.

```python
# get the number of count for each value of column "points"
wine_reviews.groupby('points').points.count()

# result:
# points
# 80     397
# 81     692
#       ... 
# 99      33
# 100     19
# Name: points, Length: 21, dtype: int64

# get the cheapest wine in each point value category
wine_reviews.groupby('points').price.min()

# result:
# points
# 80      5.0
# 81      5.0
#        ... 
# 99     44.0
# 100    80.0
# Name: price, Length: 21, dtype: float64

# get the name of the first wine reviewed from each winery in the dataset
wine_reviews.groupby('winery').apply(lambda df: df.title.iloc[0])

# result:
# winery
# 1+1=3                          1+1=3 NV RosÃ© Sparkling (Cava)
# 10 Knots                 10 Knots 2010 Viognier (Paso Robles)
#                    ...                        
# Ã Maurice    Ã Maurice 2013 Fred Estate Syrah (Walla Walla V...
# Å toka                         Å toka 2009 Izbrani Teran (Kras)
# Length: 16757, dtype: object

# group by multiple columns
# get the wine with highest points by country and province
wine_reviews.groupby(['country', 'province']).apply(lambda df: df.loc[df.points.idxmax()])

# agg() lets you run a bunch of different functions on your DataFrame simultaneously
wine_reviews.groupby('country').price.agg([len, min, max])

# result:
# 	        len	    min	  max
# country			
# Argentina	3800.0	4.0	  230.0
# Armenia	  2.0	    14.0	15.0
# ...	      ...	    ...	  ...
# Ukraine	  14.0	  6.0	  13.0
# Uruguay	  109.0	  10.0	130.0
```

#### Multi-indexes

`groupby()` sometimes result in a multi-index depending on the operation you run.

A multi-index has multiple levels.

```python
countries_reviewed = wine_reviews.groupby(['country', 'province']).description.agg([len])
countries_reviewed

# result: 
# 		                        len
# country	  province	
# Argentina	Mendoza Province	3264
#           Other	            536
# ...	      ...	              ...
# Uruguay	  San Jose	        3
#           Uruguay           24

type(countries_reviewed.index)

# result:
# pandas.core.indexes.multi.MultiIndex

# convert multi-index to regular index
countries_reviewed.reset_index()

# result:
#     country	  province	        len
# 0	  Argentina	Mendoza Province	3264
# 1	  Argentina	Other	            536
# ...	...	      ...	              ...
# 423	Uruguay	  San Jose	        3
# 424	Uruguay	  Uruguay	          24
```

### Sorting 

```python
countries_reviewed = countries_reviewed.reset_index()
countries_reviewed.sort_values(by = 'len')

# result:
# 	  country	province	            len
# 179	Greece	Muscat of Kefallonian	1
# 192	Greece	Sterea Ellada	        1
# ...	...	...	...
# 415	US	    Washington	          8639
# 392	US	    California	          36247

# descending 
countries_reviewed.sort_values(by = 'len', ascending = False)

# sort by index values
countries_reviewed.sort_index()

# result:
# 	  country	  province	        len
# 0	  Argentina	Mendoza Province	3264
# 1	  Argentina	Other	            536
# ...	...	      ...	              ...
# 423	Uruguay	  San Jose	        3
# 424	Uruguay	  Uruguay	          24

# sort by multiple columns
countries_reviewed.sort_values(by = ['country', 'len'])
```

### Data Types

`dtype`: The data type for a column.

The data type of String is `object`.

```python
# get the data type for column 'prices'
wine_reviews.prices.dtype

# result:
# dtype('float64')

# get data types for all columns
# similar to df.printSchema() in Spark
wine_reviews.dtypes

# result:
# country        object
# description    object
#                 ...  
# variety        object
# winery         object
# Length: 13, dtype: object

# convert a column of one type into another
wine_reviews.points.astype('float64')

# result:
# 0         87.0
# 1         87.0
#           ... 
# 129969    90.0
# 129970    90.0
# Name: points, Length: 129971, dtype: float64
```

### Missing Values

Entries missing values are given the value `NaN` (Not a Number). For technical reasons these `NaN` values are always of the `float64` dtype.

```python
# filter data that the value of column 'country' is NaN
wine_reviews[pd.isnull(wine_reviews.country)]

# filter data that the value of column 'country' is not NaN
wine_reviews[pd.notnull(wine_reviews.country)]

# replace NaN value with "Unknown"
wine_reviews.region_2.fillna('Unknown')
```

Some sentinel values can be used for fill `NaN`: "Unknown", "Undisclosed", "Invalid".

### Renaming 

```python
# rename column 'points' to 'score
wine_reviews.rename(columns = {'points': 'score'})

# rename some elements of the index
wine_reviews.rename(index = {0: 'firstRow', 1: 'secondRow'})
```

It is rare to rename index values. 

Both the row index and column index can have their own `name` attribute. `rename_axis()` method may be used to change these names. For example, 

```python
wine_reviews.rename_axis("wines", axis = 'rows').rename_axis("fields", axis = 'columns')
```

### Combining

Three core methods for combining different DataFrames and/or Series: (in order of increasing complexity)

- `concat()`
- `join()`
- `merge()`: Most of what `merge()` can do can also be done more simply with `join()`.

#### `join()`

Combine different DataFrame objects which have an index in common. 

```python
left_df = df.set_index('<common_column>')
right_df = df.set_index('<common_column>')
# "lsuffix" and "rsuffix" parameters are necessary here because both dataframes have the same column names
left_df.join(right_df, lsuffix = '_left', rsuffix = '_right')
```

### Snippets

```python
import pandas as pd

# set max number of rows to display as 5 when showing DataFrame
pd.set_option('display.max_rows', 5)

# set max number of columns to display as 5 when showing DataFrame
pd.set_option('display.max_columns', 5)

# display all columns when showing DataFrame 
pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)

# do not hide content of columns even if it is too long when showing DataFrame 
pd.set_option('display.max_colwidth', -1)

# pop() removes a column from the data frame, and returns it as a Series
Extract a column: my_series = <df_name>.pop('<column_name>')

# replace value
<df_name>.<column_name>.replace('<value_to_replace>', '<replacement_value>')
```

## Scikit-Learn (sklearn)

With sklearn, there are four main steps to train a machine learning model: 

1. Instantiate a model with specified hyperparameters: this will configure the machine learning model you want to train.
2. Train the model with training data: during this step, the model will learn the best parameters to get predictions as close as possible to the actual values of the target.
3. Predict the outcome from input data: using the learned parameter, the model will predict the outcome for new data.
4. Assess the performance of the model predictions: for checking whether the model learned the right patterns to get accurate predictions.

Each algorithm will have its own specific hyperparameters that can be tuned. If you leave the hyperparameters blank, the model will use the default values specified by sklearn.

**Recommend**: at least set the `random_state` hyperparameter in order to get reproducible results every time that you have to run the same code.

---

## Data Visualization

Three major considerations for Data Visualization:

- Clarity ensures that the data set is complete and relevant. This enables the data scientist to use the new patterns yield from the data in the relevant places.
- Accuracy ensures using appropriate graphical representation to convey the right message.
- Efficiency uses efficient visualization technique which highlights all the data points.

A **histogram** is a good way to visualize how values are distributed across a dataset. Sometimes, it can also help you to detect outliers.

While a **scatter** plot is an excellent tool for getting a first impression about possible correlation, it certainly is not definitive proof of a connection.

Even if a correlation exists between two values, it still does not mean that a change in one would result in a change in the other. In other words, **correlation does not imply causation**.

Vertical and horizontal **bar** charts are often a good choice if you want to see the difference between your categories.

If you are interested in ratios, then **pie** plots are an excellent tool.

Sometimes, a Series contains a few smaller categories. As a result, creating a pie plot with `<series_name>.plot(kind="pie")` will produce several tiny slices with overlapping labels. To address this problem, you can lump the smaller categories into a single group. Merge all categories with a condition, e.g. total under 100,000, into a category called "Other", then create a **pie** plot.
