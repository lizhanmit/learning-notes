## Test Hygiene

### Test Naming

It is **recommended** to always come up with a descriptive name for the test method so it is immediately obvious what the unit test does without looking at the implementation of the test method.

Name the test after the behavior.

Rules of thumb: 

- Use domain terminology: Align the vocabulary used in your test names with that used when describing the problem domain or referred by the application itself.
- Use natural language: Every test name should be something that you can easily read as a sentence. It should always describe some behavior in a readable way.
- Be descriptive: Shortest name is not necessarily best.

### Behavior Not Implementation

You should only be testing the public behavior of whatever is being tested.

The tests should only invoke the public API methods of the system and not try to inspect the internal state of the objects or the design. This is one of the key mistakes made by developers that leads to hard-to-maintain tests. 

Relying on specific implementation details results in brittle tests.

## Code Coverage

Code coverage refers to how much of the source code of your software (i.e., how many lines or blocks) is tested by a set of tests.

It is a good idea to aim for high coverage. **Recommend** aiming for 70%â€“90%.

However, code coverage is not necessarily a good metric of how well you are testing your software. It does not say anything about the quality of your tests. 

Popular code coverage tools in Java include JaCoCo, Emma, and Cobertura.

## Tips

Use `Assert.fail("Not yet implemented");` as a placeholder before you implement the test code.
